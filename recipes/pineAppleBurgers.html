<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Seasoned hamburger and a slice of pineapple are slapped together, and wrapped
  in bacon. It's that easy, and adds a wonderful flavor to a regular burger!
  This recipe was one of my grandmother's favorites. We would make these special
  for her when she would come up to see us.
